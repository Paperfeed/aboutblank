Boilerplate for a Vue project using Typescript, Babel, PostCSS, VueX, Router, Storybook, GraphQL (incl. GraphQL server with mocking) and Bulma.

To get it up and running just run 
```npm install```

To start the GraphQL server and run the client locally run 
```npm run serve``` and ```npm run apollo```.
 This will run the Vue app and GraphQL server in watch mode - 
 allowing any updates to immediately propagate
 
For the rest just look in the ```project.json```
